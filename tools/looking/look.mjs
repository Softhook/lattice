/**
 * **Looking, reduced to measurement.** Renders a running page in headless Chrome and returns
 * numbers about the frame instead of a picture of it — so that an agent which cannot see an
 * image can still act on what is wrong with one.
 *
 * This exists because of a real result. Three agents were given one sentence and an empty
 * directory. The one that could look at its game caught four defects a compiler cannot see: a
 * viewport fitted to a tile rectangle so half the frame was empty ocean, a HUD drawn in the
 * game's night ink so three rows were black on black, light pools landing at the elevation they
 * were given rather than the ground they lit, and a flat price that made losing the cheapest
 * way to play. The one that could not look shipped near-black roofs and a small diorama in an
 * empty frame. **Three of those six have a signature in a histogram, and this script finds those
 * three.** The other three are named below, under what it does not catch, because a harness that
 * claimed all six would be the same mistake as a suite that passes over a black screen.
 *
 * **No dependencies, by design.** It speaks the Chrome DevTools Protocol over a WebSocket it
 * implements itself and decodes PNG with `node:zlib`, so it runs in a directory whose
 * `node_modules` has just been created by `npm create vite`, with no second install, no network,
 * and no version of puppeteer to keep in step with a browser.
 *
 * ## What it catches
 *
 * | reading | the failure it names |
 * |---|---|
 * | `anything` | a flat field of one color — the black screen, however it was reached |
 * | `framing` | a world that is a small diamond in a big empty frame. Measured at **99%** on the diorama the blind run shipped and **29%** on a world that fills the viewport, so the gap is not subtle |
 * | `motion` | a static first frame — a screenshot of a game rather than a game |
 * | `legibility` | HUD text that cannot be read against what is behind it. The black-on-black rows measure **contrast 1.03** against a required 3, and every node that clears 3 but misses WCAG AA is named in the same row without failing it |
 * | `console` | the exceptions and warnings a screenshot cannot show you |
 *
 * Note what `anything` is **not**: there is no brightness floor. A night game is legitimately
 * dark, and a threshold on mean luminance would fail exactly the games this kit is best at. The
 * black-screen test is flatness — one color and a rounding error — not darkness.
 *
 * ## What it does not catch, stated as plainly as what it does
 *
 * It has no opinion about whether the picture is any **good**. It cannot tell a lighthouse from
 * a grain silo, cannot judge silhouette or palette, and cannot see whether the beam sweeps the
 * way the sentence promised. A bright, busy, moving frame of complete nonsense passes every row.
 *
 * Specifically, of the six defects that prompted it, **three are outside its reach**:
 *
 * - **A roof painted in the outline slot**, so it renders near-black. This was tried and
 *   withdrawn. Anchored to the modal color it fires on every well-framed night scene, because
 *   once the world fills the frame the modal color is a lit tile and the sea is legitimately
 *   darker than it. A measure that is red on good frames trains an agent to ignore the report,
 *   which is worse than not measuring. **That defect is closed at source instead** — see the
 *   fills-versus-outlines slot table at the top of the `art` skill.
 * - **A light pool landing at the wrong elevation.** The frame is lit, the pool is round, the
 *   numbers are ordinary; only knowing what was *meant* to be lit distinguishes it.
 * - **A price curve that makes losing cheapest.** Not a picture at all. No frame of any game
 *   has ever had a signature for it.
 *
 * And three standing blind spots in the readings it does take:
 *
 * - **Depth and density** — two of the five rows in `looking.md` — are not in here. Nothing in a
 *   pixel histogram distinguishes four hundred huts from thirty. `--eval 'order.count'` is how
 *   you ask the game itself, and that is the intended answer rather than a workaround.
 * - **Motion is one second of wall clock.** A game whose only animation is a thirty-second day
 *   cycle reads as static and is not.
 * - **Text is found in the DOM.** A HUD painted into the canvas has no nodes, so `legibility`
 *   reports zero nodes — which is not the same as passing, and prints as its own sentence.
 *
 * So it is a floor, not a verdict: is there a frame, is anything moving in it, can the writing be
 * read, did anything throw. That is the whole of what the blind agent got wrong at the level a
 * number can see, and none of what makes a game worth playing.
 *
 * ## Use
 *
 * ```bash
 * node tools/looking/look.mjs http://localhost:5173
 * node tools/looking/look.mjs http://localhost:5173 --json --out shots/
 * node tools/looking/look.mjs http://localhost:5173 --eval 'window.__lattice.order.count'
 * node tools/looking/look.mjs http://localhost:5173 --advance 30s          # half a day later
 * node tools/looking/look.mjs http://localhost:5173 --at '__lattice.setHour(3)'
 * ```
 *
 * ## Choosing the hour rather than accepting it
 *
 * A day cycle has a worst hour and an author sees whichever hour was on screen when they looked.
 * One stranger's game was verified by its author at dawn, where it is lovely, and measured **84%
 * of the frame near-black across 98% of the border** when this script was later pointed at the
 * same build. Nothing was flaky; the clock had moved.
 *
 * So there are two ways to say *when*, and both are the `--eval` path with the timing moved:
 *
 * - `--advance DURATION` shifts the page's wall clock forward — `Date.now()` and `new Date()` —
 *   with the patch installed **before the first line of the page runs**, so the game is born at
 *   that hour rather than jolted to it. (Applying it after load instead makes any "has the day
 *   rolled over?" latch fire on the jump. Measured on the orchard above: the same shift applied
 *   mid-run opens its end-of-day panel over the scene, and the report then describes the panel —
 *   `motion 0.00%`, six legibility rows failing against a scrim — rather than the game.)
 * - `--at EXPRESSION` runs an expression in the page after load and before the capture, on the
 *   same `Runtime.evaluate` call `--eval` already uses. For a game that exposes its own phase.
 *
 * **`--advance` is narrow, and knowingly so.** It reaches a cycle read off the wall clock —
 * `(Date.now() % DAY_MS) / DAY_MS`, which is the shape a game with offline progress already has.
 * It does **not** reach a cycle accumulated from `dt` inside `loop.onUpdate`, and cannot: the loop
 * clamps a jump to `maxCatchUpMs` (250 ms) on purpose, so a shifted monotonic clock would buy
 * 250 ms of daylight and a corrupted `worstGapMs` reading. Those games need `--at` and a hook.
 * An expression that throws exits `2` — being unable to reach the hour you asked for is a failure
 * to look, never a passing game.
 *
 * Exit code is `0` when every row passed, `1` when a row failed (so `&&` works), and `2` when
 * the script itself could not run — a missing Chrome is a `2`, never a `1`, because "I could not
 * look" and "I looked and it is broken" are different sentences and an agent must not confuse
 * them.
 *
 * `--out DIR` writes `frame-a.png` and `frame-b.png`. An agent that *can* see images should pass
 * it and then open them: the numbers are the floor and the picture is the ceiling, and this
 * script is the same rung of the ladder either way.
 *
 * Impure by nature: spawns a browser, opens a socket, writes files.

   * them. Across all 660 readings it changes **zero** verdicts: the only node in the corpus at
   * 24 px or over is `terraces`'s `319 px` at 30 px/800, which measures 4.58 and clears both
