/**
 * How a game defines its own building without forking the kit.
 *
 * **No DOM, no canvas — this module runs unchanged in Node.**
 *
 * The source game's answer to this question was one hand-written function per building type, in
 * kit source, which is a fork by construction. The answer here is a **{@link SolidWriter}: an
 * emitter a game writes its massing against once, which the kit replays through three different
 * consumers.**
 *
 * | replayed through | gives you |
 * |---|---|
 * | a writer bound to a `Pen` | the building, drawn |
 * | a writer bound to a `RenderTarget` — a sub-pen | the shop thumbnail |
 * | a writer that only unions corners | {@link spriteBounds} and {@link spriteVolume}, for free |
 *
 * Not a data schema: a `Solid[]` array is serialisable and cannot express "four posts in a loop,
 * and a mast only above level 2" without growing a small interpreter. Not a bare draw callback
 * either: a callback can be drawn and nothing else. An emitter is written like code and is still
 * replayable.
 *
 * ## The two hooks, and why they are separate
 *
 * `massing` is static art and `animate` is live art. The split enforces rule three of the source
 * game's art direction *structurally* — **something moves on every building** — in a slot that
 * is named and separate rather than as a thing an author remembers to add. It is also what would
 * make a bitmap cache tractable if one were ever needed: a building whose blinking LED was baked
 * in would be a building that stops blinking, which is a worse bug than a slow frame.
 *
 * ## Determinism is structural here, not documented
 *
 * `massing` receives `(writer, variant, rng)` **and nothing else**. There is no channel through
 * which unkeyed state can reach the art: no surface to reach for, no clock, and an `Rng` the kit
 * seeds from `variant.seed` on every call. A rack cannot reshuffle its LEDs on reload, and a
 * replay from a seed lands on the same pixel. A closure over a game object defeats all of that
 * in one line, and the signature is the only thing standing in its way.

 * it is also the only way a game gets a tinted, faded massing at all: the writer that does the
 * tinting is module-private, so a caller cannot assemble one from the public primitives.

 *   is given, so the specter stands exactly where the real sprite would. See {@link drawSprite}.
