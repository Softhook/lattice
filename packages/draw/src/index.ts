/**
 * `@latticekit/draw` — one color and one grid footprint into a stylised isometric solid, on a
 * surface it does not own.
 *
 * The two halves of that sentence are the two things this package is for. *One color* is the
 * art direction: three-tone faces derived from a single hex, cool shadows, warm highlights, a
 * silhouette stroke on everything. *A surface it does not own* is the engineering: **nothing in
 * this package, and nothing above it, ever holds a `CanvasRenderingContext2D`** — so the same
 * code paints the world, a shop thumbnail and a golden test, and a WebGL backend can replace the
 * Canvas2D one without a sprite noticing.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const surface = createCanvas2dSurface(canvasEl);
 * const pen = beginFrame({ surface, camera, palette, t, clear: 'sky' });
 * isoTile(pen, 4, 7, 'ground');
 * isoBox(pen, 4, 7, 2, 2, { color: 'brand', h: 3 });
 * endFrame(pen);
 * ```
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * **A sorted draw list, a depth key, a comparator or a `Rect`.** All four are `iso`'s. There is
 * one sorted list in the kit; `draw` walks `DepthSorter`'s permutation in the Solids pass and
 * contributes nothing to how it got ordered — and **must not reorder it**, because `pickSorted`
 * walks that same instance backwards and a partitioned repaint makes a player tap a rack and
 * open the headquarters behind it.
 *
 * **A sprite bitmap cache.** It was in the RFC as provisional, with deleting it named as a clean
 * outcome, and the benchmark decided: direct drawing of a thousand sprites costs a small
 * fraction of the 8 ms budget, so a cache would have bought zoom buckets, palette revisions,
 * pixel snapping and a don't-fill-while-moving rule — four new ways to render something stale —
 * in exchange for nothing. `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` has the number. The `massing`/`animate` split
 * survives it and was never only about caching: it is what makes a sprite's static art
 * declarative and its motion explicit.
 *
 * **Bezier paths, concave polygons, clipping, a general composite API, a transform stack,
 * filters, images the kit did not render, and perceptual color interpolation.** Each is either
 * something a WebGL backend could not honour in fifty lines without lying, or something that
 * would change every screenshot in the kit and improve none of them. `docs/rfc/draw.md` §4 has
 * the reason for each, which is what stops the next agent adding it back.
 *
 * **Hit-testing.** `iso` owns picking. This package contributes `spriteBounds` and
 * `spriteVolume` — the geometry a pick test needs — and stops there. In particular it never
 * records what it drew for picking to read back, because a frame the renderer skipped would then
 * leave the controls somewhere the building is not.
 *
 * **Lights that cast shadows or are occluded.** A lamp behind a hill still spills over it. Real
 * occlusion needs a shadow map per light and a depth buffer this renderer does not have, and it
 * would cost more than everything else in the package put together. This is the largest honest
 * limitation here.
 *
 * **A serialization format for color.** `draw` has no serialization and must never grow any:
 * the moment it can write a color to a save, someone writes a presentation-tier value into a
 * document that travels between engines. **Store the hue; derive the tokens on load.**

//
// `canvas2d` is the only module in the package that names a canvas. `record` is `src/` rather
// than `test/` because a headless op stream is a product feature, not a test fixture: the Replay
// exhibit (`G11`) proves "same seed, same log, same pixel" by comparing op streams, which needs
// no canvas and no image diff. **It has no consumer today** — `ui`'s thumbnails use
// `createOffscreenSurface`, not this, and nothing in `ui` or `examples/` names
// `createRecordingSurface`. The comment this replaces claimed `ui` wanted it for layout
// measurement without a canvas; that reader did not exist, and a justification naming a present
// consumer nobody checked for is how an orphan survives two audits. Naming a *planned* one
// instead makes the next audit checkable: measure this module against `G11` shipping, and if
// `G11` is cut, revisit it the same day — it is 0.85 kB of a package that is over budget.
